I have written comments for almost every line to explain what I have done.
For further reference, I took snippets of code from my <a href="https://github.com/HariAcidReign/ImageRecognition">Image Recognition</a>, and my <a href="https://github.com/HariAcidReign/DS-and-ML-Resources/blob/master/CNN%20using%20TF%20and%20Keras.ipynb">CNN with Keras and Tensorflow</a> repositories. Check them out too.
